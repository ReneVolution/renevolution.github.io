Wow, what a big jump from FFmpeg 1.2 => 2.0. But there is a whole bunch of new impressive features e.g FTP Protocol support or filter graph description readable from file just to name two. You can find all updates at [http://www.ffmpeg.org](http://www.ffmpeg.org). I'm really looking forward to test the new features and share my observations here.
