On the way looking for great footage for my next tutorials i stumbled upon a new great short movie named "Tears of Steel". It is created with the open source 3D creation software [blender](http://www.blender.org/). You may know blender from short movies like [Sintel](http://www.sintel.org/) or [Big Buck Bunny](http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/), if not you should definetly take a look at [blender's gallery](http://www.blender.org/features-gallery/movies/). "Tears of Steel" is published under [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license which allows me to use and remix it.

The movie is freely available for download from the [Mango-Project Website](http://mango.blender.org/download/) in different resolutions and formats up to 4k. They also provide subtiles and sound files. I choose this movie as i want you being able to use the same video materials as i use in my tutorials. As 4k movies need a lot CPU power, i'll focus on the 1080p HD format. This is also consuming a lot of CPU but more than a half less than 4k video.

I hope you like it too as i will use it for my upcoming tutorials. The upcoming topics will be scaling, cropping, letterboxing, watermarking and so on.

Enjoy the movie...
